          Hi, My name is Yuvraj Bajwa. I am a graduate of The University of
          Auckland, Where I studied Computer Science and Information Technology
          Management. At the university, I learned many things. But the most
          important things I learned were how to communicate ideas and work well
          with teammates. I have a great attitude with a can-do mentality. Once
          I start a project, I have to see it through. I have a big drive to
          deliver all deliverables before the deadlines to allow time for any
          mishaps. I am a highly passionate person who puts 200% effort into my
          work. I am ready to start Working ASAP as I am improving my skills
          daily. I want to work for a company that treats me well as a worker
          and provides me opportunities to learn and grow.

        <h4>MovieFlix ‚Äì Flask (Python) Project</h4>
        <p>

          ><br />
          MovieFlix is a web app made using flask for backend, jinja frontend,
          and SQL alchemy as the database interface language. Jinja is a
          templating engine. So, all the pages are built on abstraction and
          extend on a base class. Flask is used to route and generate webpages
          using the jinja templates. The website has login and register
          functionally and uses signed cookies to protect against CSRF attacks.
          This project was a semester-long project where I received an A+ grade
          for the website and its functionality.

          During my final project, students got assigned to a team of 5-7 people
          each. I decided to work on a project called Online Job board to gain
          experience working in a group working on a web development project for
          the semester.
          <br />
          <br />
          The project's goal was to make a CRM system and an exclusive web
          portal where students could view Job listings from different
          companies. In the CRM system, an admin could moderate any incoming Job
          listings and manage a list of companies, along with Other features.
          Likewise, in the Student Portal, Students needed to view job postings
          and save the job postings they were interested in pursuing.
          <br />
          <br />
          We decided to make the web application using the most popular
          technologies, such as MERN stack, Material UI, Figma, Trello, Vercel,
          ESlinter, Postman and other minor technologies to help realise the
          project. These technologies significantly reduced development time for
          features we discussed in the group discussion meetings. We had to fill
          in the minor details in the project. We knew the clients could only
          help understand a generalise idea of a product they wanted. We wrote
          these ideas down in Trello, and we recorded the other details later in
          the project report.
          <br />
          <br />
          By creating this web application with my team of 7, we learned many
          skills in the technologies we were using to develop the application.
          It was good to know the clients were thrilled to see the number of
          details and effort we put into creating the web app. Overall for this
          project, my group received an A+ grade which was fantastic.

        <p>
          I have learned many fundamentals of software development, user
          interactions, algorithms, and data structures in my Computer Science
          Degree. I have mainly used these fundamentals and applied what I had
          learned in class to my projects. By taking the courses in the computer
          science degree, I have gained an excellent understanding of the
          process of software development and engineering. Hopefully, I will get
          to use this knowledge and experiences better the world.
