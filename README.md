# MyPortfolio

The Personal Portfolio Website is an ongoing web project for me to show off my skills as Software Engineer.
Currently, the website acts as my profile.
Employers could see all details and find links to LinkedIn/ Github.
I have added many ways to contact me on the website, such as a contact me form. 


#In the future, I want to add :

personal blog sections to the website,
navigation tools such as a floating navigation bar (since the Page is getting pretty Big), 
and lastly, I want to add more 3D objects in the background to make the website a personification.
